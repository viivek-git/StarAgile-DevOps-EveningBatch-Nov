Port Forwarding OR Port Mapping:
===================================

By default an application on docker container is avaibale on its exposed port.

It is the users internet that cannot reach the container port

For this we have do port forwarding or mapping in docker

i.e. we have to map a VM free system port with container port

example = 8989:80

systemport:containerport

> If a container is already created, we canot do port forwarding for the container

> port forwarding will be applied at the docker run comamnd itself

> flag for port forwarding (-p)

# docker run --name web1 -d -p 8989:80 nginx


> if you want docker to do port mapping then use flag -P

# docker run --name web2 -d -P httpd
