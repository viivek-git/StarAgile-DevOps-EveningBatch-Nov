Docker Volumes:
========================
Bind Mount:
===========================
In this case, data will be saved on any directory of host machine

I have got source code for webapplication in github

https://github.com/Sonal0409/ecomm.git

we will clone the code in docker host in a directory

we will mount the directory on a container with image httpd

We will access the application on the container form browser of our machine


=====================================================================
  Dockerfile:
================================================================

It is a simple file with no extension, it has the name dockerfile or Dockerfile 

No programing or scripting language is used to write this file

We just use keywords given to us by Docker and pass arguments/commands to these keywords

Syntax:  keyword argument/command

# to write comments

1. FROM 
This is the first keyword in the dockerfile 
With this keyword we will mention the name of the any Docker Base image over which we want to customization

2. ENV 
This keyword can be repeated multiple times in the dockerfile
Using this keyword we will define environment variables and its values
These variables can further be used in other steps of the dockerfile

3. LABEL
It is not mandatory, with this we give the key=value. It is like metadata/information about dockerfile 

4. RUN 
This keyword can be repeated multiple times in the dockerfile 
With this keyword we will give Linux command to install/upgrade packages
When a container is launched and you want a set of commands or packages to be laready executed and present on the container
You can mention that in dockerfile using RUN keyword 

5. COPY 
Can copy any file from the Docker host on to the containers directory
However it cannot copy .tar files on the containers

6. ADD 
Can copy any file from the Docker host on to the containers directory
can copy .tar files on the container directory 

7. EXPOSE 
With this keyword we will mention target port of the container 

8. Volume 

With this keyword we will mention the directory of the container that will preserve the data on the host machine

9. CMD

With this keyword we will mention a command that will run after  the container is launched 
However, this command can be replaced by a new command that is passed by the admin with docker run command

10. ENTRYPOINT

With this keyword we will mention a command that will run after  the container is launched 

However, this command CANNOT be replaced by a new command that is passed by the admin with docker run command
New command get appended as an argument to the EntryPoint command

11. WORKDIR
This keyword is written in the beginning of the dockerfile after FROM keyword
This keyword will create a working directory on the container
Then rest of dockerfile commands will run in this working directory by default
============================================

Example:
============================================

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install nginx -y
COPY index.html /var/www/html/
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

build dockerfile into an Image

# docker build -t myimage01 .

# docker images

Push the image in docker hub
==================================

From host machine loginto dockerhub

# docker login

username of dockerhub:
password

Need to chnage name of the image and add repository name where it has to be pushed in docker hub

docker tag oldimageName dockerhubaccountName/imagename

# docker tag myimage01 sonal04/myimage01

Push the image

# docker push sonal04/myimage01
